-- Test Data Type Casting for Payment Triggers
-- This script tests that VARCHAR(20) columns are properly cast to TEXT in functions

-- Test 1: Create a test bill with VARCHAR(20) status
INSERT INTO bills (

    created_by,
    status,
    total_amount,
    paid_amount,

-- Test 2: Verify the bill was created with correct data types

-- Test 8: Record another payment to test status change to 'paid'
INSERT INTO payment_history (
